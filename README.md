# Refactor-COM-object-to-VBA-COM-wrapper-class

Aim: To refactor COM object to extract VBA COM wrapper class.  This is in regard for the requirement to construct COM wrappers for classes at [DotNetLib]( https://github.com/MarkJohnstoneGitHub/DotNetLib).  As there are "numerous" properties and methods for each COM object to wrap aim to automate.
